* Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for my nixOS setup, using riverWM configured in haskell through [[https://codeberg.org/Hikari/river-hs][river-hs]].

** Necessary stuff
 It might be needed to run
 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 dbus-update-activation-environment WAYLAND_DISPLAY
 #+END_SRC
 so dunst finds the WAYLAND_DISPLAY variable correctly.


** Information
This is a flake based setup, most things have been split into modules and home-manager has been used (though, I am contemplating a switch to the much simpler [[https://github.com/viperML/wrapper-manager][wrapper-mananger]]).
This also houses my emacs config which can be found in [[./conf/emacs.el]], it uses Nix as its package manager instead of Elpaca or Straight.el
